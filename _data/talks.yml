      The Web Audio standard is enabling the creation of fully functional Audio
      application made with open Web technologies. This talk will go through
      the basics of the functionality that Web Audio enables, and highlight
      some open source libraries, frameworks and projects built on top of Web
      Audio.

      And you might also have come across the
      <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/01nov_ismsounds/">
      sounds of interstellar space</a> that NASA shared couple of years ago.


      We have two great masterpieces to get started with. In my talk I will
      briefly discuss about both and then jump into Swift (Apple's new
      programming language) and SceneKit to create music visualization of the
      interstellar sounds.

  talk:
    title: 'Signal-ing Out of Callback Hell'
    description: >
      Async processes are hard to reason about. Especially when you're
      debugging them under four layers of nested callbacks.  From handling
      complex UI interactions to coordinating parallel tasks, programming in an
      async world can be frustrating, especially if you're using an imperative
      programming languange/framework with mutable state.


      This talk will examine how Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) provides
      a solution to these problems. By modelling async flows as streams of
      values, and performing transformations on those streams, FRP enables such
      processes to be written in a safer, declarative manner. This talk would
      use <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">ReactiveCocoa
      </a> and how it aids development on iOS and Mac as a case study.

    title: 'JavaScript Obfuscation'
    description: >
      JavaScript Obfuscation demystified. Everyone writing JavaScript knows
      that there are multiple ways of doing the same thing. Developers build
      filters to catch malicious JavaScript, but a wily attacker can obfuscate
      JavaScript so that filters can be bypassed.


      This session will teach participants multiple JavaScript implementation
      details and how these are used to build obfuscated code. We will also
      discuss how to dissect already obfuscated code. The session is divided
      into two parts: first part will expose participants to different
      components of JavaScript internals and how they can be used to create
      obfuscated code. The second part will help them to decipher obfuscated
      code.

    description: >
      Performance of your websites matters a great deal - especially on mobile.
      In this talk you will learn about what exactly slows down your website on
      mobile phones. JS, CSS, HTML, images, fonts - all play a very important
      role in how fast the browser is able to render your webpage.


      I will discuss how the interplay of these components affects web-page
      performance as a whole and how concepts like the critical rendering path
      can help you increase your website’s performance manifold. Using these
      techniques, we conducted an experiment on the top 100 Alexa websites. We
      were able to show a speed improvement of upto 300% on a standard 3G
      connection in some of these websites.

      Although computers have beaten humans at Chess, Checkers, and even
      Jeopardy, games with complex board states (such as Go) or hidden
      information (such as Poker) have remained out of reach. Magic: the
      Gathering is a strategy card game that has <em>both</em> complex board
      states and hidden information.

      an open source competitive computer MTG player. This talk distills some
      of the lessons learnt in developing an AI that is able to make decisions

      At the beginning was the humble HTTP 0.9, which only allows GETting a

      This talk is about using
      <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a> as a Platform. (Telegram is a
      cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app with a focus on security and
      speed.)


      My intent of this talk is to share the many ways we can make use of the
      Telegram Bot API to implement 'apps' that you can use with your favourite
      people, or even just for yourself. 


      The Telegram client can potentially save you a significant amount of
      development time, due to the simplicity of implementing your Bot and the
      already-ready simple-to-use UI.


      If you still can't conceptualise this, think of this really simple problem
      which I have solved with TaaP: my favourite people can't decide where we
      should eat for our dinner meeting later.


      I will be demonstrating the entire process (if time permits :D) of solving
      my problem above, in Ruby.
