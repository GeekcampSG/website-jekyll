    title: Signal-ing Out of Callback Hell
    description: >
      Async processes are hard to reason about. Especially when you're
      debugging them under four layers of nested callbacks.  From handling
      complex UI interactions to coordinating parallel tasks, programming in an
      async world can be frustrating, especially if you're using an imperative
      programming languange/framework with mutable state.


      This talk will examine how Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) provides
      a solution to these problems. By modelling async flows as streams of
      values, and performing transformations on those streams, FRP enables such
      processes to be written in a safer, declarative manner. This talk would
      use <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">ReactiveCocoa
      </a> and how it aids development on iOS and Mac as a case study.

      JavaScript Obfuscation demystified. Everyone writing JavaScript knows
      that there are multiple ways of doing the same thing. Developers build
      filters to catch malicious JavaScript, but a wily attacker can obfuscate
      JavaScript so that filters can be bypassed.


      This session will teach participants multiple JavaScript implementation
      details and how these are used to build obfuscated code. We will also
      discuss how to dissect already obfuscated code. The session is divided
      into two parts: first part will expose participants to different
      components of JavaScript internals and how they can be used to create
      obfuscated code. The second part will help them to decipher obfuscated
      code.

      In this talk you will learn about what exactly slows down your website on
      mobile phones. JS, CSS, HTML, images, fonts - all play a very important
      role in how fast the browser is able to render your webpage.


      I will discuss how the interplay of these components affects web-page
      performance as a whole and how concepts like the critical rendering path
      can help you increase your website’s performance manifold. Using these
      techniques, we conducted an experiment on the top 100 Alexa websites. We
      were able to show a speed improvement of upto 300% on a standard 3G

      people, or even just for yourself.


      The Telegram client can potentially save you a significant amount of

      already-ready simple-to-use UI.


      If you still can't conceptualise this, think of this really simple problem

      on a corpus, and suggestion an answer that is "best" rather than "right".

      At Viki we handle thousands of requests per second and we store the logs
      at each microservice level for easier debugging later.
      I will share my experiences with building a scalable setup for ELK.
      
      For fun, I will also use a small setup for analyzing Twitter public stream
