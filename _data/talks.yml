    title: "RactiveJS: Make Your Life as a Webapp Developer Simpler"
    description: >
      Many tools exist to help you build web apps, but very few deal with the fundamental problem:
      HTML, while excellent at describing static documents, wasn't designed for interactivity.
      Ractive changes that.


      RactiveJs is very simple to get started and it's powerful enough to help you get things done
      perfectly without the hassle and learning curve.


      It also has great performance.

    title: Exploring the Option of Having One Source Repo to Rule Them All
    description: >
      Both Google and Facebook keep all their source code in one single repository, is there
      something there to learn from them?


      This talk will go over advantages and disadvantages to putting all your code into one
      repository. There's also some interesting aspects to how your CI/CD pipeline starts looking
      when you're taking everything from the same repository.


      Likely talking points will be:
      <ul>
      <li>Git vs Mercurial</li>
      <li>CI/CD servers and how they'll work with this (Concourse, GoCD, and some cloud solution
      like CircleCI or SnapCI)</li>
      </ul>

      As the creator of <a href="https://engineers.sg" target="_blank">Engineer.SG</a>, I spent 1
      year fine-tuning the techniques used in capturing and videographing conference and meetup
      talks. The system has now been replicated and taught to more than 40 volunteers.


      I will now share how it is done with the GeekCamp.SG audience.

      Category theory is an esoteric branch of math which has found a use in Functional Programming
      (Haskell, Scala etc.). I will explain what Category Theory is, why it is useful and show you
      how you can use in your own work.


      If you don't know how to make a Monad by the end of my talk, I will have failed.

    description: >
      A common refrain is that "big" orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes may not be worth the
      effort to implement, particularly in small organisations that are resource-strapped. I'd like
      to share our experience at Lomotif in shifting our production architecture over to Kubernetes,
      the rationale for doing so, and naturally, the wins and frustrations we experienced along the way.


      We'll also do a quick overview of Kubernetes and its major components and concepts.

      ES5, ES6; runs on any browser, any host, any OS, and it's open source.


      This technical talk will go through the various improvements of TypeScript, writing Angular 2
      and React in a more succinct, object-oriented, typed way yet still having all the flexibility
      and benefits of JavaScript.

      developments, with Sawtooth Lake (from Intel) now publicly available, new protocols, chain
      code, and consensus models.


      This technical talk will not only cover the concepts of Blockchain and the updates on the
      HyperLedger Project, but also show you how to set up and deploy Fabric and/or Sawtooth Lake,
      running your own Blockchain and start recording into your ledger.

      Contractual Agreements into Smart Contracts on the blockchain. This has use cases for
      Financial Institutions, Insurance Companies, Government Registries, Hospitals, etc. The
      platform can help compress workflows, thus leading to increases in efficiency and reductions
      in costs in several antiquated industries which still use fax machines and snail mail or are
      not sharing vital data with one another securely.

  talk:
    title: What You Should Know About Streams
    description: >
      The way we consume services from the Internet today includes many instances of streaming
      data, both downloading from a service as well as uploading to it or peer-to-peer data
      transfers. Regarding data as a stream of elements instead of in its entirety is very useful
      because it matches the way computers send and receive them (for example via TCP), but it is
      often also a necessity because data sets frequently become too large to be handled as a whole.
      We spread computations or analyses over large clusters and call it “big data”, where the whole
      principle of processing them is by feeding those data sequentially—as a stream—through some
      CPUs.


      This talk is a primer to understanding how the Akka Streams API work, its motivation and
      design.

      I'm learning to build a simple keychain with sensors that can tell the owners about some
      environmental status through BLE and their iPhone app.


      In this talk, I will be covering the BLE protocol and how to build both the hardware and app
      to view the sensor data. What are some key things to look out for in the BLE protocol? What
      are some of the common hardware chips, dev kits and firmware API? What are some hardware tools
      to work on a MacOS? On the software side of things I will be touching on the web bluetooth
      API, node js and Swift iOS to build an iPhone app.


      Building with BLE can be pretty fun for quick short-range wireless applications! And I hope
      to share my learning with the GeekCamp audience.

      Segfaults, Buffer Overflows, Data Races and Memory Leaks cross over unprotected memory with ease.
      They steal our jobs, crash our code, cause vulnerabilities in openssl. We need to be tough.
      The liberals from C and C++ have kept these borders open for too long. It's time to build a wall...


      Rust is a systems programming language designed for speed, safety, concurrency and hype. It features
      a radical memory model that gives YOU control, rather than those pesky garbage collectors,
      while still maintaining compile time safety gurantees.


      This talk will introduce Rust, focusing on the fabled memory model, the motivations behind it's design and
      the consequences.
